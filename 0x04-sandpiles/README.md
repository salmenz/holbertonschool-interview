#0x04-sandpiles
<ul>
<li>Prototype: <code>void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);</code></li>
<li>You can assume that both <code>grid1</code> and <code>grid2</code> are individually <strong>stable</strong></li>
<li>A sandpile is considered <strong>stable</strong> when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains</li>
<li>When your function is done, <code>grid1</code> must be <strong>stable</strong></li>
<li><code>grid1</code> must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)</li>
<li>Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically</li>
</ul>
